# GEDCOM-Tree-Visualizer
Initial Release - contains bugs (not really tested yet, works with the GEDCOME file I have)

Issues:

1. Displays tree view of PATERNAL families, showing the maiden name of the spouses, but not including the spouse's parents.
2. Root nodes are currently hardcoded. Need to parameterize this.
